SAVR Attend - AI-Powered Attendance System
SAVR Attend is a smart, AI-driven attendance management system built with Python and Streamlit. It leverages real-time face recognition to automate the tedious process of taking attendance, providing a seamless experience for both teachers and students through an intuitive web interface.

‚ú® Key Features
üë§ Dual User Dashboards: Separate, secure login and dashboard views for Teachers and Students.

üì∏ Photo-Based Attendance: Teachers can upload a single classroom photo, and the system automatically detects and marks all recognized students.

üé• Live CCTV Monitoring: Monitor attendance in real-time using a live feed from a CCTV camera (via RTSP URL) or a standard webcam.

ü§î Manual Review System: For low-confidence matches, the system prompts the teacher to manually confirm a student's status (Present or Absent), ensuring 100% accuracy.

‚¨ÜÔ∏è Bulk Student Enrollment: Easily enroll an entire class by uploading an Excel file with student details and a ZIP file with their photos.

üìä Dynamic Reporting: All attendance sessions are saved as CSV files. The reports page allows teachers to load, view, and analyze past attendance records with visual charts.

üñºÔ∏è Visual Feedback: Both photo and CCTV modes provide visual feedback by drawing bounding boxes around detected faces (Green for recognized, Red for unknown).

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Backend: Python

Web Framework: Streamlit

Face Recognition: face_recognition (built on dlib)

Image Processing: OpenCV, Pillow

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

1. Prerequisites

Python 3.9 or higher

git clone [https://github.com/Harsha-Sampangi/SAVR-AI.git](https://github.com/Harsha-Sampangi/SAVR-AI.git)
cd SAVR-AI

Create and activate a virtual environment:

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

Install the required dependencies:
The project is organized within the savr_ai folder. Install requirements from there:
